		"pC": "<p>Undertale is an amazing game. I really enjoyed my time playing it. I listen to the sound track a lot(I'm doing it as I write this). I even read a fanmade <a href=\"https://undertale-au.fandom.com/wiki/Category:AUs\">AU</a> called <a href=\"https://invertedfate.com/chapters\">Inverted Fate</a>. The only thing that I haven't done(and don't intend on doing) is a <a href=\"https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Genocide_Route\">Genocide Run</a>. But, there's one thing that's kinda been bugging me since it first found out about it. It's the fact that their's a version of <a href=\"https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Undertale_(Soundtrack)\">Undertale(the song)</a> that wasn't added, and instead was replaced with the version we have now.</p><h1>The Current Version</h1><p>The version we got of Undertale was a pretty good one. It's a little sad, while also filled with hope(just like the monsters in the neutral route. It is kinda the song of their hope, since it only plays during the end of the neutral route). Below is the version we got in the game.</p><audio controls><source src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/undertale/images/6/66/Undertale_%28Soundtrack%29_music_1.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\"><source src=\"https://ia902907.us.archive.org/29/items/undertaleost_202004/Undertale%20-%20Lossless%20Soundtrack%20%28toby%20fox%29/toby%20fox%20-%20UNDERTALE%20Soundtrack%20-%2071%20Undertale.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"><source src=\"https://ia802907.us.archive.org/29/items/undertaleost_202004/Undertale%20-%20Lossless%20Soundtrack%20%28toby%20fox%29/toby%20fox%20-%20UNDERTALE%20Soundtrack%20-%2071%20Undertale.flac\" type=\"audio/flac\">It looks like your browser doesn't support the audio tag. <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/undertale/images/6/66/Undertale_%28Soundtrack%29_music_1.ogg\">This is a link to the audio so that you can download it if you so choose.</a></audio><h1>The One that could have been</h1><p>This one is also greate, and I personally think I like it a lot better than the one we have. I feel like it's more happy in tone. Even if it might not fit with what the game would have been trying to fit it's context into, it's still a good song on it's own.</p><audio controls><source src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/undertale/images/6/64/Undertale_%28Soundtrack%29_music_unused.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\"><source src=\"https://a.tumblr.com/tumblr_odg4sv0r3Z1s58ev6o1.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">Again, it looks like you're browser doesn't support audio, so you can <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/undertale/images/6/64/Undertale_%28Soundtrack%29_music_unused.ogg\">download the song</a> to listen to it. </audio>"

There are many ways to make one.</p><p>First let me tell you why I write these programs. These programs, at least in my opinion, are good when you're learning a new programming language. It gives you a problem to solve, and all you need to do to solve it. Incase you're wondering, the problem is to make a program that counts from 1 to 100 and replaces all multiples of 3 with Fizz, all multiples of 5 with Buzz, and multiples of both with FizzBuzz. Generally in interviews, they also ask you to add on more multiples, such as multiples of 7 are replaced with Fuzz, and multiples of 11 are replaced with Bizz.</p><p>Now that I've told you what a FizzBuzz Program is, let me show you how I make them in Psuedo-Code.</p><div class=\"code\">for i in 1-100 {<div style=\"margin-left:1em\">toPrint = \"\"<br>print(toPrint)</div>}</div><p>The first thing I do is I create a for loop, and within it I put a print statement and a variable named toPrint.</p><div class=\"code\">def check(checktomulti, multi, toreturn) {<div style=\"margin-left:1em\">if checktomulti % multi == 0 {<div style=\"margin-left:1em\">return toreturn</div>}<br>return \"\"</div>}<br>def checkEmpty(string, number) {<div style=\"margin-left:1em\">if string == \"\" {<div style=\"margin-left:1em\">return number</div>}<br>return string</div>}<br>for i in 1-100 {<div style=\"margin-left:1em\">toPrint = checkEmpty(check(i, 3, \"Fizz\") + check(i, 5, \"Buzz\"), i)<br>print(toPrint)</div>}</div><p>The next thing I do is I define a function that checks if one number is a multiple of another, and if it is, then it returns the string, otherwise, it returns an empty string.</p><p>Then I make a function that checks if a string is an empty one, if it is, then it returns a number.</p><p>Once I have these 2 functions, I go back into the for loop and make the toPrint variable have the variable for checking if a string is empty(and if it is replace it with a number) check if 2 of the other function that check if one number is a multiple of another(and if it is, return a string). Finally, it prints the output.</p><p>I've tried this method many times.
