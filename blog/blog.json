The answer is, infinity... but why?</p>Well, according to the mathematicians, it's because you can fit infinite 0s of people into 1 room.<div>It's weird... I know. So why don't we correct this? Because the mathematicians decided that x/0=infinity... and ifyou know one, you'd know that they don't really like to be corrected.

Part of the reason for this is so that inspect can be on mobile.<p>but what makes inspect so important?<\/p>Well I'm glad I asked!<div>So on GitHub, you only have 2000 actions you can do(on the free plan). So that means you need to use them carefully, make sure that you won't do something that wastes an action.<\/div>It helps you fix any mistake, before you make anymore. <div>Of course, you can always download the file, and edit it offline.
