Hey there! I'm 
<a href="/index.html">Steve0Greatness</a>
, so in 
<a href="Scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1">Suggestions</a>
, you may want to get your idea across.
<div>
  in order to do that, you need mockups.
  <div class="bigtext">
    What are mockups?
  </div>
  <div>
    Mockups are what you make to show people your idea.
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  Now that that questions out of the way, I'll now get on with the tutorial.
</div>
<div>
  so first you want to go a page that looks like what you want to make, then open up inspect element in the right click menu.
  <div>
    then you need to click on 
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/687RdVd/Screenshot-2021-04-10-3-02-03-PM.png" alt="'Select an element on this page to inspect it.'" border="0">
     and click on the first element you want to edit to edit it.
  </div>
  <div>
    Then looks at the element highlighted in light blue, try not to get intimidated, and only look at a small area around the hightlighted bit.
    <div>
      if you want to edit an image, find an image link, and click it 2 times, you it should bring you to a text editor, you can use this area to edit text, urls, image urls, ex.
    </div>

  How do I show my mockup on the forums?
</div>
<div>
  You need a screenshot, and an image host, I'd suggest using
