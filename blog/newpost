You may know about, or even use, Roblox. If you don't know, basically, it's a game that lets you make other games, and play games by others.

Anyways, that's not the thing that I'm here to talk about, what I'm here to talk about is their assets. Stuff like sounds, images, gifs, shirts, pants, t-shirts, ex. All of those have their own Id, different from all other Ids on the platform. But that Id isn't the only Id that they get.
