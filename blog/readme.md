# Creating New Posts
## JSON temp:
```json
"--name of post--": {
	"pD": "--date of writing--",
	"fT": "--not currently in use--",
	"pC": "--Content of the post--"
}
```
## Creating the Content:
1. Wrtie the post in the `newPost.html` so that you can see what it will look like, there's no need to erase it when your done, as long as you do that when you make a new one, you clear out it's contents.
2. Remove all indents and new lines
3. Replace all  `"` & `/`s with `\"` & `\/`
4. Once you're done, make sure to add it's name to the name list found in `script.js`
