# Creating a new project.
## step 1
Create the thing. You can't do anything if it doesn't exist.

```json
{
	"name": "--name of the project--",
	"fileName": "--name of file that it will direct to--",
	"desc": "--description of project--",
	"status": /*if there's no need for this, only add null*/,
	"date": "--date of creation--"
}
```
