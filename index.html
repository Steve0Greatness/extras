	I'm Steve0Greatness(also known as S0G and StevesGreatness). You can find me on <a href="https://stevesgreatness.repl.co/accounts">many sites</a>.<br>
	I'm a kinda-sorty self taught programmer(if you count stackoverflow, mozilla, and w3schools as "self taught"). I mostly use JS, and Python, but I don't use Python as much. I use Replit, and VSCode, I used to use the basic text app, but it's not a very good code editor, I personally perfer Replit over everything else, but VSCode is cool.<br>
	Anyways, I've made <a href="https://stevesgreatness.repl.co/projects">alot of things</a>, including somethings on this site(like <a href="/blog/">my blog</a>, &amp; <a href="/extras/" title="things ranging from useful programs, to april fools recreations">the extras</a>)
