# Steve0Greantess.Github.io
This is the repository of my([Steve0Greatness](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/steve0greatness)) Github.io site.

## Who am I?
I'm a mostly self taught programmer. Not in the way that I learned it all by myself, but in the fact that I mostly used online resources if I had a question.

I develop mostly using [Replit](//replit.com). But I do have [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed, and I do use it.

## What is on here?
Here I have a blog, a collection of all my alt accounts on Scratch, and some "extras;" extras are basically a bunch of projects, infact, that part of the site used to be called "extra projects," but I changed it to just extras, for... reasons. What!? I don't have to justify things on my own site! Anyways, extras range in usefulness, from a recreation of an 4/1 joke, to projects only I would really find useful, to things done better by other people.
